# Parser

The `Parser` class is the entry point for using _BigXML_.

## Instantiation

Call `Parser` with any number of [streams](streams.md) as arguments:

    :::python
    Parser(stream0, stream1, ...)

Each stream is consumed, in order, to get the raw XML data to be parsed.

## Methods

`iter_from`

: Takes any number of [handlers](handlers.md) and returns an iterable whose items are
generated by the handlers when the streams are parsed.

`return_from`

: Just like `iter_from`, but returns the last item generated (or `None` if nothing is
generated).
